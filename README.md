# Tic_Tac_Toe_web
The webpage is a simple Tic Tac Toe game where two players can play against each other. The player names are taken from the previous page, and the game is displayed on a board with clickable squares. Each player takes turns to place their mark ("X" or "O") on an empty square. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, a custom message shows the winner's name. The webpage also has a reset button to start a new game.
